# Header, full-screen menu, mobile bar, section dots

## What it is
Floating pill header (pattern from Vittorio's site) that hides on scroll down; full-screen menu over living petrol waves with huge items and scissors hover; on phones the menu becomes link-tree style stacked buttons; mobile bottom bar with WhatsApp booking; section dots on large screens.

## Demo
Open `demo/index.html` through a local server from the kit root: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000/sections/05-header-menu/demo/`. Look at `screenshots/` for phone (390), tablet (820) and desktop (1440).

## Must keep
Focus trap, Esc, scroll lock, Apple Maps on iOS / Google Maps elsewhere.

## Device rules (no cropping, ever)
- Test at 360x740, 390x844, 768x1024, 820x1180, 1024x768, 1366x1024, 1440x900, 1920x1080. Screenshots of this demo at 390/820/1440 are in `screenshots/`.
- Use `svh/dvh` for full-height blocks (never `100vh` alone), `clamp()` for type, `aspect-ratio` boxes for media, `object-fit: contain` for cut-outs (people, mascot, products) and `cover` only for photos that can lose edges safely (set `object-position` per image).
- Cut-outs (Fabio, mascot, products, tools) must never be cropped by the viewport except where the design says so (bottom of the hero). Text and buttons are never covered by decorations (decorations live in `--z-decor`, below content).
- Safe areas: `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on fixed UI. Touch targets at least 44 px.

## Production notes
- Stack: Astro + vanilla TS, GSAP 3 (ScrollTrigger, SplitText, Flip) + Lenis. The demo already uses the same libraries from `shared/vendor/` and the same smooth-scroll setup (`shared/smooth.js`: Lenis lerp .075, native touch), so motion and feel must match the demo 1:1.
- Tokens and fonts: `shared/glamood.css` (copy into `src/styles/tokens.css`). Fonts are self-hosted in `shared/fonts/`.
- Images: the demo uses `assets/web/*.webp`. Production must regenerate responsive AVIF/WebP from `assets/masters/` (sharp) with width/height attributes.
- Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (see the demo code paths marked `reduced`).
